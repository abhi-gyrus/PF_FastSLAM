# Grid-based FastSLAM on Turtlebot
This project aims to implement the Grid-based FastSLAM algorithm on a Turtlebot. FastSLAM is a probabilistic algorithm for solving the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problem. FastSLAM uses particle filters where each particle represents its belief of the robot's pose. Each particle also has a map that it updates by taking laser scan measurements of its environment.
